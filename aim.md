### Aim of the experiment

After having studied DFAs and NFAs, a natural question to ask is the following.

> Are there languages that are accepted by NFAs but not by DFAs?

It was shown that the answer to the above question is **no**. In fact, there are algorithms to construct equivalent deterministic finite automatons, given a non-deterministic finite automaton as input.

This experiment is designed to show that NFAs and DFAs are equivalent by constructing an equivalent DFA of the given NFA (through power-set construction).
