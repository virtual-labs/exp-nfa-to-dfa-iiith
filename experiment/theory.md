# Introduction

Assuming that the reader has the understanding of DFAs and NFAs, we pose the following question to them.

> Are there languages that are accepted by NFAs but not by DFAs?

Another way to think about this question is the following.

> Are there languages that truly use the power of non-determinism.

As it turns out, the answer to the questions above is **no**. This is extremely surprising to understand that non-determinism does not add much power to the finite automata with respect to computability.

We shall now show that given any non-deterministic finite automaton that accepts a language $L$, we can construct a deterministic automaton that also accepts $L$. Recall that when we defined NFAs, we spoke of multiple possibilities of transition from the current state upon reading a letter of the input, and $\varepsilon$ transitions. These gave the finite state machines the power of non-determinism. In particular, we said that the machine splits into multiple copies when it encounters a situation of multiple transition possibilities. 

> How does one encode the notion of "multiple copies of a finite state machine running in parallel"?

One way to encode this is through the power-set construction. Let us illustrate that using an example.

Now let us stare at the transition table of this NFA $N_1 = (Q = \{q_1, q_2, q_3\}, \Sigma = \{0,1\}, \delta, q_1, \{q_1\})$ and try to construct a DFA $D_1 = (Q', \Sigma, \delta', S, F)$ that accepts the same language as $N_1$.

|       | $0$            | $1$   | $\varepsilon$ |
|:------|:--------------:|:-----:|--------------:|
| $q_1$ |                | $q_2$ |         $q_3$ |
| $q_2$ | $\{q_2, q_3\}$ | $q_3$ |               |
| $q_3$ | $q_1$          |       |               |

Now let us rewrite this transition table as follows.

|           | $0$            | $1$       | $\varepsilon$ |
|:----------|:--------------:|:---------:|--------------:|
| $\{q_1\}$ |                | $\{q_2\}$ |     $\{q_3\}$ |
| $\{q_2\}$ | $\{q_2, q_3\}$ | $\{q_3\}$ |               |
| $\{q_3\}$ | $\{q_1\}$      |           |               |

Note that we need to keep track of the transitions across multiple copies of the machine, deterministically. Towards this the following idea could work.

> Can we create a new finite state automaton whose states are labeled by subsets of $\{q_1, q_2, q_3\}$.

Let $Q'$ denote the power-set of $\{q_1, q_2, q_3\}$. Let $\Sigma'$ be the same as $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$. Now we shall the define the transitions as follows.

For a subset $R$ of $\{q_1, q_2, q_3\}$ and a letter $a$ of the alphabet, we could possibly define the transition function $\delta'$ as follows. 

$$\delta'(R,a) = \{q \in Q \mid q\in \cup_{r\in R}\delta(r,a) \}.$$

For example, $\delta'(\{q_2\}, 0) = \{q_2, q_3\}$, $\delta'(\{q_1\}, 0) = \emptyset$, and so on. But this does not take care of $\varepsilon$-transitions. Recall that $\varepsilon$-transitions create copies of the machine without reading a letter of the input. For any subset $R$, let $E(R)$ be defined as follows.

$$E(R) = R\cup \{\text{states $q$ that are reachable from some $r\in R$ via one or more $\varepsilon$ transitions}\}.$$

Thus, we modify the above definition of $\delta'(R,a)$ as follows.

$$\delta'(R,a) = \{q \in Q \mid q\in \cup_{r\in R}E(\delta(r,a)) \}.$$

Now the start state of the machine $D_1$ is the set of all the states that are reachable from $q_1$ (the start state of $N_1$) via $\varepsilon$ transitions. That is, $E({q_1})$. Final states $F'$ of the machine $D_1$ are going to be the set of states in $Q'$ that contain an accepting state of $N_1$.

We show this pictorially as follows.
