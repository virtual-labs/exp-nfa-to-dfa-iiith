### Simulation Steps

#### Step 1: Select NFA Example
- Choose from the provided NFA examples in the dropdown menu
- Each example demonstrates different aspects of NFA to DFA conversion
- The selected NFA will be displayed with its formal specification

#### Step 2: Examine the Original NFA
- Review the NFA structure including states, alphabet, transitions, and accept states
- Pay attention to non-deterministic transitions and epsilon (ε) transitions
- Understand the language accepted by the NFA

#### Step 3: Start the Conversion Process
- Click the "Convert NFA to DFA" button to begin the subset construction algorithm
- The conversion will proceed step by step, showing each stage of the process

#### Step 4: Follow the Conversion Steps
- Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through conversion steps
- Each step shows:
  - Current DFA state being processed
  - Symbol being processed
  - Move operation result
  - Epsilon closure calculation
  - New DFA state creation or existing state identification

#### Step 5: Analyze the Resulting DFA
- Examine the final DFA structure
- Compare the number of states between NFA and DFA
- Verify that the DFA accepts the same language as the original NFA

#### Step 6: Explore DFA Minimization (Optional)
- Click "Show DFA Minimization" to see the minimization process
- Observe how equivalent states are grouped together
- Compare the minimized DFA with the original converted DFA

#### Step 7: Toggle Visualizations
- Use "Show/Hide Diagrams" to control the visual display
- View the automata as both diagrams and formal specifications
- Use diagrams to better understand state transitions and structure

#### Step 8: Experiment with Different Examples
- Try different NFA examples to see various conversion scenarios
- Compare how different NFA structures affect the resulting DFA
- Observe cases where the DFA has exponentially more states than the NFA
