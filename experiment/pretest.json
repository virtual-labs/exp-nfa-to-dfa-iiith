      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. NFA stands for Non-deterministic Finite Automaton, which allows multiple transitions from a state on the same input symbol.",
        "b": "Incorrect. NFA does not stand for New Finite Automaton.",

        "a": "DFA has more states than NFA",

        "d": "NFA cannot have accepting states"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The number of states depends on the specific automaton, not the type.",
        "b": "Correct. NFAs can have multiple transitions from a single state on the same input symbol, while DFAs have exactly one transition.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Both NFAs and DFAs can use the same alphabet.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Regular transitions consume input symbols, but epsilon transitions do not.",
        "b": "Correct. Epsilon transitions allow the automaton to move between states without consuming any input symbol.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Epsilon transitions can lead to any state, not just accepting states.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This describes states reachable by regular transitions, not epsilon closure.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Epsilon closure is not related to accepting states specifically.",
        "c": "Correct. The epsilon closure includes the original states plus all states reachable through epsilon transitions only.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. DFA states in subset construction represent multiple NFA states.",

        "d": "When it has no outgoing transitions"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A DFA state is accepting even if it contains non-accepting NFA states, as long as it contains at least one accepting NFA state.",
        "b": "Correct. A DFA state is accepting if it contains at least one accepting state from the original NFA.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The start state is not necessarily accepting unless it meets the condition in option b.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The presence of outgoing transitions does not determine if a state is accepting."

        "a": "Incorrect. The worst-case complexity is much higher than linear.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The worst-case complexity is exponential, not quadratic.",
        "c": "Correct. In the worst case, the subset construction can create up to 2^n DFA states for an NFA with n states.",

        "a": "All DFAs can be minimized to have exactly one state",
        "b": "DFA minimization always reduces the number of states",
        "c": "The minimized DFA accepts a different language than the original",
        "d": "DFA minimization removes equivalent states while preserving the accepted language"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Not all DFAs can be minimized to one state; it depends on the language they accept.",
        "b": "Incorrect. If a DFA is already minimal, minimization won't reduce the number of states.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The minimized DFA must accept exactly the same language as the original DFA.",
